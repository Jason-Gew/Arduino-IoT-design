# Arduino-IoT-design #

Personal Arduino IoT use cases. Will keep updating new designs.

Focus more on IoT devices, Network Protocols (Ethernet/WiFi, UDP, MQTT, ZigBee, Bluetooth LE GATT/GAP), 
Wireless Communication (WiFi, XBee/ZigBee, Bluetooth LE, SigFox, LoRa) and Cloud Provisioning.

Embedded System focus on both Baro Metal Chip and RTOS (FreeRTOS and uCOS II).
